# Motion Layout Toolbar ðŸ“±

A showcase app that reproduces the new **large top app bar style** introduced in Android 12.


## Android development

This implementation uses Motion Layout to achieve the desired scrolling behaviour.
Motion Layout gives us flexibility and a lot of options to customize the motion animations.

However, if you want to achieve the same effect using a standard component take a look at the implementation of [CollapsingToolbarLayout](https://m3.material.io/components/top-app-bar/implementation/android#collapsing-top-app-bars) in Material 3.
